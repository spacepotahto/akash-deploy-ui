# Akash Deploy Website
Akash is an open source Cloud platform that lets you quickly deploy a Docker container to the Cloud provider of your choice for less than the cost of AWS. See https://akash.network/ for more information.

While the official product requires the use of the command-line, a deploy UI can lessen the learning curve and reduce friction. In my opinion, the ideal UI should be in the form of a website with Keplr wallet integration. There should be no setup or installation. One should just be able to visit the website with some AKT in their Keplr wallet, and click a couple of buttons to deploy. This demo showcases a proof of concept of such a vision.

This demo is made possible with the [AkashJS](https://github.com/spacepotahto/akashjs) library that replicates much of the command line functionality in JavaScript.

A version of the demo is hosted at https://2g0cl9g6u0mn6vrbiajv5p9h508vbfq07j6fm060dl8lci85k436jh0.siasky.net/.
